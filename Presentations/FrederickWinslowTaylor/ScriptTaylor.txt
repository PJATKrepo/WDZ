Today, I would like to talk about Frederick Winslow Taylor, a man who completely changed the way we think about management and work organization.
  Taylor is often called “the father of scientific management.”
He believed that productivity could be improved through careful analysis, planning, and cooperation between managers and workers — rather than relying on intuition or tradition.
  In this short presentation, I’ll show you who he was, what ideas he developed, and how his principles still influence modern management today.

On this slide, you can see the essence of Taylor’s idea.
He believed that every job could be analyzed scientifically — that efficiency wasn’t a matter of luck or experience, but of data and observation.
  He timed and studied workers’ movements, eliminated unnecessary steps, and created what he called “the one best way” to do each task.
  This method became the foundation of what we now know as scientific management.

Taylor’s ideas quickly spread across the industrial world.
In 1911, he published his famous book “The Principles of Scientific Management,” which became a cornerstone of management theory.
  His approach inspired Henry Ford to develop the assembly line — a system that revolutionized production and shaped the modern world.
Even today, many management principles — planning, standardization, efficiency — are based on Taylor’s original ideas.

To sum up, Frederick Winslow Taylor transformed the world of work.
He believed that through science and organization, people could achieve more with less effort.
His influence can still be seen in every company and industry today.
  Taylor’s main idea — work smarter, not harder — remains true even a century later.
Thank you for your attention.
