Slide 1 – Introduction

Good morning everyone!
Today, I want to talk about one of the most fascinating companies in the world — Netflix.
We all know it as the platform where we watch movies and series, but what makes Netflix really special is its culture.
It’s called “The Culture of Freedom and Responsibility.”

This idea completely changed how people work and create inside the company.
Netflix believes that when you give people freedom — and trust them — they can do truly amazing things.

So today, I’ll show you what makes Netflix’s culture so unique, how it started, and why it works so well.



Slide 2 – What Makes Netflix Different

Netflix started in 1997 as a DVD rental company.
But over the years, it became the biggest streaming platform in the world.

What’s interesting is that Netflix didn’t just change technology — it changed the way people think about work.

Instead of controlling every decision, they give employees a lot of freedom.

For example, people can work in the way they feel is most productive, and share their ideas openly.

Netflix believes that creativity grows best in an environment of trust — not fear.

And this approach helped them create shows like Stranger Things, The Crown, and Money Heist that millions of people love.




Slide 3 – The Founder and His Vision

The person behind this philosophy is Reed Hastings, the co-founder and former CEO of Netflix.

His vision was simple: “If you give smart people freedom, they’ll do amazing things.”

He didn’t want to build a company full of rules — he wanted a company full of responsible people.

Instead of managers constantly checking what employees do, Netflix gives them the context they need — and lets them decide.

Reed Hastings believed that the best work happens when people feel trusted, not controlled.




Slide 4 – Inside Netflix’s Culture

Netflix’s culture became famous because of something called the Culture Deck.

It’s a long document that explains how the company works, what values they believe in, and what kind of people they hire.

It was published online — and millions of people read it!
Even companies like Google and Facebook started to learn from it.

The main message is: “Freedom and responsibility.”

Employees can make decisions about their projects, their time, even how to spend company money — but they must take full responsibility for the results.

This creates a strong sense of trust and ownership.



Slide 5 – Key Principles

Netflix’s culture is based on several key ideas.

First — Freedom and Responsibility. Everyone acts like a leader.

Second — Context, not Control. Managers don’t give orders — they share information.

Third — High Talent Density. Netflix hires only top performers. If someone isn’t a perfect fit, they are replaced.

And finally — Open Feedback. Employees are encouraged to be honest, even with their bosses.

This honesty keeps the company flexible, creative, and strong.



Slide 6 – Innovation Through Trust

At Netflix, people are trusted more than in most other companies.

There are no strict working hours, no dress code, and even no vacation limits.

You can take as many vacation days as you want — as long as your work is done well.

Employees don’t need approval to buy things or make creative choices.

The only rule is to use good judgment and think about what’s best for the company.

This trust gives people confidence and helps them innovate — to come up with new ideas that push Netflix forward.




Slide 7 – Global Impact

The Netflix culture doesn’t just affect their own employees — it’s changing the whole entertainment world.

Because Netflix gives freedom to creative people, we now see content from all over the globe —
from Korean dramas like Squid Game to Spanish hits like Money Heist and many others.

This freedom allows people to express their culture and tell unique stories that audiences everywhere can enjoy.

Many companies now study Netflix’s model because they want to build similar creative environments.
